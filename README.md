# Face Detection Using OpenCV for Digital Image Processing

## 📚 Overview
This project showcases the implementation of a face detection system using **OpenCV** in Python, leveraging the principles of **Digital Image Processing**. It integrates key concepts such as image transforms, enhancement, restoration, segmentation, and compression, demonstrating their practical applications.

The project was developed as part of an academic curriculum, focusing on the end-to-end pipeline of digital image processing.
